## Introduction

In this article I want to dive in philosophy and particulary in a western one. This article would be **precise** and will include **fundamentals** of **Ancient Philosophy**. I will try my best to explain Ancient Philosophy to those who are not familiar with it.

## Pre-Socratic Philosophy

Generally, we divide **Western Philosophy** into two categories: **Pre-Socratic** and **After Socrates.** Pre-Socratic period in Hellenic Culture starts generally with **Homer**, one of the greatest poet and is followed by **Hesiod**. However, **Pre-Socratic Philosophy** starts with **Thales.** Thales is founding father of **Western Philosophy** and is one of the **Seven Sages** of Hellenic Culture. He *probably* studied in **Babylon** and after getting education he predicted solar eclipse. Thales founded his own school called **Milesian School.** **Milesian School's** famous philosophers are generally 

1. Thales 
2. Anaximander
3. Anaximenes

## Pythagoras

Pythagoras was ancient **Ionian** greek philosopher, polymath and founder of **Pythagoreanism.** He was a quite mystic and religious figure rather than rational mathemathician as we think of today. Pythagoras most famous achievement is his **Theorem.** Yes, *that's right* the famous **Pythagorean Theorem** in math. He was not the first to find connection between cathetus and hypotenuse, but he was first to make proof of it and inventing formula. Ancient Egyptians *probably* knew that if in a right angle triangle cathetus are 3 and 4, then hypotenuse is always 5. He also discovered connections between **math** and **music,** thats why he *probably* believed that everything is made by **numbers.** I want to dive in more about this topic dear reader but I am too lazy for that.
