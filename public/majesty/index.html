It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as part of commission by Pope Julius II to decorate the rooms now called <b>Stanze di Raffaello</b> in the <b>Apostolic Palace</b> in <b>Vatican City</b>. The fresco depicts a congregation of ancient philosophers, such as: <b>Socrates, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Heraclitus,</b> <b>Averroes</b> and <b>Zarathustra</b>.</blockquote><p>If you are interested more in this gorgeous painting of Raphael, you should visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens">wiki here</a>.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In this article I want to dive in philosophy and particulary in a western one. This article would be <b>precise</b> and will include <b>fundamentals</b> of <b>Ancient Philosophy</b>. I will try my best to explain Ancient Philosophy to those who are not familiar with it.</p><h2>Pre-Socratic Philosophy</h2><p>Generally, we divide <b>Western Philosophy</b> into two categories: <b>Pre-Socratic</b> and <b>After Socrates.</b> Pre-Socratic period in Hellenic Culture starts generally with <b>Homer</b>, one of the greatest poet and is followed by <b>Hesiod</b>. However, <b>Pre-Socratic Philosophy</b> starts with <b>Thales.</b> Thales is founding father of <b>Western Philosophy</b> and is one of the <b>Seven Sages</b> of Hellenic Culture. He <i>probably</i> studied in <b>Babylon</b> and after getting education he predicted solar eclipse. Thales founded his own school called <b>Milesian School.</b> <b>Milesian School's</b> famous philosophers are generally</p><ol><li>Thales </li><li>Anaximander</li><li>Anaximenes</li></ol><pre><code>print("Thales,")

Pythagoras most famous achievement is his <b>Theorem.</b> Yes, <i>that's right</i> the famous <b>Pythagorean Theorem</b> in math. He was not the first to find connection between cathetus and hypotenuse, but he was first to make proof of it and inventing formula. Ancient Egyptians <i>probably</i> knew that if in a right angle triangle cathetus are 3 and 4, then hypotenuse is always 5. He also discovered connections between <b>math</b> and <b>music,</b> thats why he <i>probably</i> believed that everything is made by <b>numbers.</b> I want to dive in more about this topic dear reader but I am too lazy for that.</p><pre><code>return article
